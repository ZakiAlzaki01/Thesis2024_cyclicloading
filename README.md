Contained within this repository are the Python scripts utilized for the analysis in our Master’s thesis, which investigates Effect of cyclic loading on degradation of sensitivity clay for railway embankment.

For each sample of Natural Clay (NC) and Lime-Cement Mixture Clay (LCC), a dedicated Python script is provided, which analyzes the raw laboratory cyclic loading data. The data analysis follows a structured sequence of processing steps, as illustrated in the flowchart below:

Note:
The laboratory cyclic triaxial raw data is not shared here due to it is not publicly available in this repository. This is due to Chalmers University’s policy regarding data sharing.
